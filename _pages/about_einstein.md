I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Global Innovative Drug at [Chung-Ang University](https://www.cau.ac.kr/index.do), conducting research in the [Chemical/Bioinformatics Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/view/cau-chembioinfo/home?authuser=0) under the guidance of Professor [Yoonji Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/cau-chembioinfo/yoonji-lee-ph-d?authuser=0). 

My academic focus lies in the sequence-structure analysis of `Purinergic receptors`, employing computational methods such as `FEP (Free Energy Perturbation) calculations`, `MD (Molecular Dynamics) simulations`, and `molecular docking`. 

Outside the lab, I am a passionate insect enthusiast who enjoys raising `silkworms` and `rhinoceros beetles`.
